# Incompatible games

- Manuals : can't be automated purely from command line arguments
- Spyro 3 : requires admin privileges to start the client

# Bugs

- YAAL's own apworld is not future proof
- Tool Version's icon is particularly ugly, will need to be replaced at some point
- Linux-only : drop-down menus' auto-color doesn't work, leading to unreadable text

# Planned features

- Per-launcher custom theme : nearly done, but it's a gas factory, it barely works on Windows, doesn't work at all on Linux
- Per-slot password : it's coming pretty soon and for now YAAL can only deal with per-async password
- Sliders as setting input : we have binary and color input, sliders would be cool, already partially implemented but needs more work
