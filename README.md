# YAAL (Yet Another Archipelago Launcher)

YAAL is a tool meant to bring quality of life upgrade to users of the Archipelago software. It lets the user define what "opening" a game means, using simple instruction such as "Open" and "Backup". It aims to bring versionning, one-button openning and per-slot environment to any game without having to convince apworld devs to implement it themselves.

## Before using YAAL, please read this

Out of the box, this software won't do what it's supposed to. This is intentional, for security reasons. YAAL needs to be able to move and edit files, and while I tried to put as many securities as I could think off to protect users against typos and other mistakes, there's not much I can do to protect you against bad actors. For this reason, it'll be better if you took the time to make your own launchers yourself, even if it takes a few minutes, it's not hard and let you be 100% sure of what the launcher actually does. If you do happen to download someone else's launcher (they're just json files, they're easy to share), please take the time to read what it does before using it.

This software can, if you tell it to, automatically download files from github. This, again, doesn't protect you against bad actors : please only download from sources you trust.

Finally, remember that, while having these features in another software is *(in my opinion)* better than not having them at all, it'll still be better if every Archipelago user had access to them. If you feel like YAAL is making any game better, please tell their respective world devs about it and ask them to port the features you feel like their apworld is missing.

## Now that you're ready, how do you use YAAL ?
